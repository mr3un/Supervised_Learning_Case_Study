# Supervised_Learning_Case_Study

This is a case study i done in 2022 Fall for Gatech CS7641 Machine Learning Course for supervised learning. 

What is in it:
- Dry Bean Dataset from UCI https://archive.ics.uci.edu/datasets](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/602/dry+bean+dataset
- Adult Income Dataset from UCI https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult
- Comparsion of Discison Tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Adaboost DT, Support Vector Machine (SVM), MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) / Neuron Network (NN) in context of these two dataset
- Disscussion of these model performance and unique features of each class of model
